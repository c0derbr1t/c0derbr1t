## I'm Brittani Luce.

### About Me:

💜 &nbsp;&nbsp; Kindness, tolerance, and passion is everything.

🤯 &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm currently seeking endorsement with Lambda School after a rigorous year of intensive learning.

👩🏻‍💻 &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm actively looking for my first great Web Development position. I'd love to work in the Kansas City Metro area or remotely, but I'm open to relocation. The Pacific Northwest looks so lovely!

🌱 &nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm working on growing and expanding my skills and knowledge through small projects.

💬 &nbsp;&nbsp; Ask me about my three obnoxious but lovable cats!
